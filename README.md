# [Build a Material Design App][published url]
## Instructor: [Ashraff Hathibelagal][instructor url]


Google's Material Design has quickly become a popular and widely-implemented design language. Many Android users now expect their apps to conform to the Material Design spec, and app designers will expect you to be able to implement its basic principles.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Ashraff Hathibelagal will show you how to build a practical, fully functional material design app that is ready to publish on Google Play. Starting from the app design created by Adi Purdila in his course [Getting to Know Material Design](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/getting-to-know-material-design), you will learn how to work with the various material design UI widgets, such as `FloatingActionButton`, `TextInputLayout` and `RecyclerView`, available in the Android Support library. You will also learn how to perform read and write operations on a modern mobile database called Realm.
